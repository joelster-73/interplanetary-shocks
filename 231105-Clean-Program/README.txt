A note on the different folders and files:
> GitHub-Code: Code for Clement, (just to retrieve data and plot it);
> JR1532_Code: The code I submitted for my project;
> SerPyShock-main: Code from the Trotta Paper
> Updated-Code: The code I updated just after I submitted my project, (plots SW and MSH data together)
> Val-Code: Val's code

The files used in my program:
> shock_analysis.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook to retrieve, analyse, and plot the plasma data
> data_functions.py: The functions to retrieve and filter the plasma data;
> calc_functions.py: The functions used to analyse the plasma data;
> rankine_functions.py: The functions used to analyse the RH quantities of the data;
> SerPyShock.py: The functions from the Trotta paper.

The only file that needs to be changed is the shock_analysis.ipynb file, changing the satellite time, spacecraft, and method.
